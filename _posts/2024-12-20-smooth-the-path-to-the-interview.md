We often make interviews harder than they need to be—both for ourselves and for the high performers we’re trying to identify.

Interviews can be more effective and efficient if we take a few simple steps before we even get in the room (or on the call). I want interviews that are smooth and packed with accurate information. When candidates aren't focused, it’s harder for us to get the insights we need—and it wastes everyone's time.

Plus, I have really high standards—I want to see candidates give their best, so I can identify who the real high performers are.

Here are three things you can do to make your interviews run more smoothly and give top candidates more opportunity to shine—ranked from most to least obvious:

1. Prepare!
Take the time to research the candidate. Read their CV. It’s shocking how often interviewers skim it right before the call or, worse, during the interview itself. Instead, spend 10 minutes beforehand reviewing their LinkedIn profile, any notes from your recruiter, and make your own notes. A well-prepared interviewer looks professional, creates a better experience for the candidate, and can ask more insightful questions.

2. Ask the candidate what they need to interview well.
Structured interviews are essential, but adaptive interviews show that you know what you're doing. Before the interview, send a simple question like:
"We want the interview process to be smooth for everyone. What is your biggest concern about the interview process?"
This not only puts the candidate at ease but also helps you tailor the conversation to their needs and expectations.

3. Send the interview questions in advance.
I structure my interviews with a solid rubric—a skeleton that keeps things on track and ensures we cover key competencies. I send candidates the high-level questions upfront (Yes, the exact questions I ask verbatim in the interview) but not the exploratory follow-ups or my detailed definitions of what good looks like. This doesn’t limit spontaneity or adaptability; it gives candidates a fair chance to showcase their skills while allowing you to dive deeper into their experiences.

When you do this, expect candidates to come prepared. I want my candidates to bring notes, have researched the role and company, and ask challenging questions—leading to a richer, more insightful conversation.

Following tips like this removes barriers (and excuses) to a poor interview performance.
